# News Articles Share Prediction using Machine Learning

---


## Project Overview

### Business Overview

Our project aims to predict the number of shares news articles will receive on various online platforms. News agencies, bloggers, and content creators are always interested in understanding how popular their articles will be. Predicting the number of shares can help them tailor their content and promotional strategies.

### Aim

To predict the number of shares news articles will receive using machine learning algorithms based on various article attributes.

### Data Description

The dataset comprises news articles and their associated attributes, such as title, text, publication date, keywords, and more. These attributes can be used to predict the article's shareability.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, seaborn

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather a dataset of news articles with attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text cleaning
   - Feature extraction
   - Handling missing data
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand data distributions
   - Identify correlations
4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features from existing data
5. **Machine Learning Models**
   - Build and train machine learning models to predict shares.
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimize model hyperparameters.
8. **Model Deployment**
   - Create an API or web application for share prediction.
   - Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
9. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**
   - Monitor model performance and retrain as needed
